                        <p id="p1">Hi there! As you can see from the title of my page my name is Gus Gonzalez. I'm 24, I live in Johns Creek, GA with my family and I graduated from Georgia Tech in 2017 with a degree in Industrial Engineering. I currently work in IT as a business analyst on an agile scrum mobile development team for a company called Primerica up in Duluth. I've always loved learning and by best classes in school were always computer science classes, so here I am finally claiming my spot as future developer. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I'm still not sure what kind of developer I really want to work as, but I'm extremely interested in backend technologies like AWS and other cloud technologies. I'm very excited to be in this class and have loved it so far! My goal for the class is to be considered one of the top students in the class (I know it's not a competition, but you know what I mean).</p>
